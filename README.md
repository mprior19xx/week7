# Rock Paper Scissors
### An electronic take
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer! Beware! You'll get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python3 terminal window. For Mac or Linux devices only!

The rules are the same as the classic game:

  1. Paper covers Rock  
  2. Scissors cut Paper  
  3. Rock smashes Scissors  

**_Choose wisely!_** 

The computer Chooses first; just follow the promts!
